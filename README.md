##  Tools and libraries requirements:
Before running the project make sure that you have installed the following:
* Visual Studio with C++ compiler ```https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/```
* nes_py library ```!pip install nes_py```
* gym library ```!pip install gym```
* gym_super_mario_bros library ```!pip install gym_super_mario_bros```
* stable_baselines3 library ```!pip install stable_baselines3```

## Training:
In order to achieve a good performance you have to train the model for more than one million time steps ```model.learn(total_timesteps=1000000)```, which requires a lot of computation power and resources, so I encourage you  to use cloud services to  run the model, such as google Colab.
